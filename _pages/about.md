I'm a consultant at Main Quad Capital providing internal startup incubation support. Earlier, I worked at Mininglamp Techonology as a computer vision algorithm engineer providing AI solutions for Parkson Retail Group.

I studied physics(Mphys) at University of Oxford where I did the research on the Lifecycle of Pockets of Open Cells using deep learning under the supervision of Dr Duncan Watson-Parris.
